1. gps-tracks in gpx-format can be added by specifying "track" in markdown using gpxviewer from [JÃ¼rgen Berkemeyer](www.j-berkemeier.de)
2. Videos are embedded if tag 'video' pointing to video file is specified in html together with "VIDEO_DEFAULT_URL" in settings
3. a visitor-counter which should be adapted for personal use in the index.html
